- - - -

## Overview 

This was a major project done in the programming language 'Turing' (For more information about the language - http://compsci.ca/holtsoft/IPT.pdf) in my 'Introduction to Computer Science Course (ICS 3U1) within my grade 11 year. The program itself attempts to relpicate the well known and love 'Microsoft Paint' program that comes preinstalled on most windows personal computers. 

## Features 

The program boasts many features including - 

* adjustable thickness
* spray paint tool
* ability to draw shapes (ractangles, squares and maple leaves) 
* colour palette with colour wheel that shows which colour is in use 

The program also integrates some more advanced features such as the ability to clear the screen, save images drawn and load previously saved images! 

## Significance 

This project signifies at pivotal moment within my early coding career because doing this project gave me my first taste with building programs with graphical user interfaces (GUI's)

I learned through the process of trial and error as well as much research about the subject about user design/experience (UI/UX) the ins and outs of creating a layout that not only looks amazing but is intuitive and easy for the user to use! These two aspects result in an amazing experience for users who use my program. 

Developing this program also gave me experience with keyboard and mouse movements and incorperating event listeners into my code
